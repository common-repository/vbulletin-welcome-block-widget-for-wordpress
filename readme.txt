Adds a vBulletin welcome block/login block widget to your blog. Useful if your website is powered by vBulletin and WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin adds the vBulletin welcome block to your blog as a widget. If the user is logged in they will see their login username, avatar, messages and stats. If the user is not logged in they will see a login form and stats including new posts count.

It works great along side the 'vbulletin/wordpress bridge' plugin for that bit of extra integration. Now members can login from a wordpress page.
